This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

```{r}
getwd()
movie <- read.csv("./movies.csv",header = TRUE,sep = ",")
rating <- read.csv("./ratings.csv",header = TRUE,sep = ",")
```


```{r}
#100004 are the number of rows in rating file
dir.create(file.path(getwd(),"./hw4.movies/"))
movie <- data.frame(lapply(movie, as.character),stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
rating <- data.frame(lapply(rating, as.character),stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
for (i in 1:100004){
  user_list <- which(movie$movieId == rating[i,2])
  user_file <- write(movie[user_list,2],paste0("./hw4.movies/user",rating[i,1],".txt"),append = TRUE)
}
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
